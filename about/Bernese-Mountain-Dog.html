<h1>Bernese Mountain Dog</h1>

<p>The bernese named refers to where the breed is from: Bern Canton, the central region of Switzerland. They were bred as working dogs, and eventually became delivery dogs. Bernese Mountain Dogs can haul up to 1,000 pounds - 10 times there own weight! They are a little immature, so they require consistent and patient training. I want to get a Bernese Mountain Dog when I am older! So cute. :)</p>
