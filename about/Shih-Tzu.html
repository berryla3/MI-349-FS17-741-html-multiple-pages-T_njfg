<h1>Shih Tzu</h1>

<p>The Shih Tzu breed is more than 1,000 years old. They came form Tibet and were sent to the Chinese royalty as gifts. When China underwent its Communist Revolution, the Shih Tzu breed all but disappeared. Because their numbers dwindled down to almost nothing, every Shih Tzu alive today can be traced to one of 14 dogs that were used to rebuild the breed. I have a Shih Tzu at home named Zoe. After reading about the Shih Tzu breed, she is even more special to me that she was before!</p>
