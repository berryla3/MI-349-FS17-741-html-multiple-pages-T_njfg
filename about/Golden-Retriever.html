<h1>Golden Retrievers</h1>

<p>Golden retrievers are the third most popular dog breed in America. They make great therapy dogs, are wonderful swimmers, and are considered to be the 4th smartest dog breed (in line behind Border Collies, Poodles, and German Shepherds). I have a golden retreiver of my own, named Holly Berry. (We got her around Christmas time, and my last name is Berry :))</p>
